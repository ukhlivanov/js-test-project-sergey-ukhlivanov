### Tests

Tests can be implemented or simply stubbed as [TODOs][jest-todos] that outline _what_ you would test.

### TODOs

If you can’t complete everything that is OK! We prefer to see a partial solution that you are proud of vs. spending lots of time to finish. We recommend documenting a list of TODOs for any remaining items you would address with more time.

### Some details we care about…

- General appearance
- Accessibility
- Load on the API
- Quality commits
- Code readability
- Consistency of code style
