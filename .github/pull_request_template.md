We’re *so* glad you are here to help us on this project! The code was shipped off to a galaxy far far away and it has… issues. :grimacing:

There is a big demo tomorrow and we need to get this into shape quickly. Please find and fix as many issues as you can in 1–2 hours. If you see any low hanging optimizations to make, go for it!

If you breeze through all of this you can spend a little more time if you like on:

- Adding test coverage
- Visualization of results as a chart or other visualization

Tests can be implemented or simply stubbed as [TODOs][jest-todos] that outline _what_ you would test.

Similarly any optimizations can be a simple list of TODOs rather than actual implementation.

:raised_hands:

Request review when you are ready. Include any notes, TODOs, etc. you would like to share in the description below.

:clock1:

We’ll be in touch within 1 business day to let you know whether we’ll proceed to the interview stage. We may leave some comments and/or clarifying questions on the PR in the interim.

Thank you again!
